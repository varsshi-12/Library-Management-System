# ðŸ“š Library Management System using PostgreSQL

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Library Management System** using **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin 4**. It focuses on core aspects of relational database systems including schema creation, data management, advanced querying, and the use of SQL features such as views, procedures, and triggers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for database structure
- Creation of multiple interrelated tables
- Data insertion and manipulation (CRUD operations)
- SQL JOIN queries for inter-table operations
- Stored functions and procedures for business logic
- Views for simplified querying
- Triggers for automatic actions
- Clean and normalized database design

---

## ðŸ§± Database Schema

### Tables Included:
- `branch`
- `employees`
- `members`
- `books`
- `issued_status`
- `return_status`

ðŸ“Œ See the ER Diagram in the [ERD](#ðŸ“Š-er-diagram) section below for relationships and keys.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**
- **pgAdmin 4**
- SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL commands)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin4**
2. Open **pgAdmin4** and connect to your PostgreSQL server
3. Run the SQL script to create all tables and relations
4. Execute INSERT statements to populate sample data
5. Explore queries, views, and stored procedures
